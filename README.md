UDP Based Multithreaded Chat Application in Java
#Prerequisite
This application is basicallyAsynchronous, asynchronous in this context means that both the server and the client can send each other texts independently without waiting for any kind of response from the other party. 
We will be using the concept of multi-threading to implement Sending and receiving text messages between the processes with the help of DatagramPackets. Datagrams are bundles of information passed between applications.
Once the datagram has been released to its intended target, it is independent and there is no assurance that it will arrive or even that some application will be there to receive it. 
Java implements datagrams on top of the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) protocol.
